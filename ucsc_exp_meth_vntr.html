<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The hub shows association of copy number changes of VNTRs (Variable Number Tander Repeat) with local gene expression and CpG methylation in two discovery cohorts ane one replication cohort for which PCR-free Illumina WGS data were available.
<h4>Discovery Cohort</h4>
<ul>
<li> A subset of quality-filtered samples from the <a href="https://gtexportal.org/home/">GTEx project</a>, comprising 404 individuals with expression data from 48 different tissues. cis-Association analysis was performed between estimated VNTR copy number and normalized gene expression within ±500kb. </li>
<br/>
<li> 235 quality-filtered samples from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001138.v1.p2">PCGC (Pediatric Cardiac Genomic Consortium)</a>  for which DNA methylation profiles from whole blood were available. cis-Association analysis was performed between estimated VNTR copy number and CpG methylation levels within ±50kb.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Replication Cohort</h4>
<ul><li>The results of discovery cohort were replicated in <a href="https://www.ppmi-info.org/">PPMI cohort (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative)</a> which consisted of total 703 individuals with WGS, gene expression and methylation data.</li></ul>
